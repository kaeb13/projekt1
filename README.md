# The same code is used for both contact and member form. I wanted the both to seem simular for the viewer and have only adjusted the text content for it's proper use. Both of these also have buttons linked to different thank you-pages. 

## Events 

<img src="assets/images/eventscreen.png" alt="printscreen eventpage" width="200" height="auto">

<h3>Testing</h3>
