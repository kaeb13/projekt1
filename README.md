  ### Features 

  ## Navigation 

  <img src="assets/images/readmefilenav.png" alt=picture-of-navigationbar width="200" height="auto">
  <img src="assets/images/navbar small screen.png" alt="picture-small-nav" width="200" height="auto">

The navbar is prominently located at the top of the page and includes clear and concise labels for each section. The font used in the navbar is in uppercase letters, giving it a bold and striking appearance yet elegant.

When you hover over a navbar item, the background inverts to pinegreen, and the text changes to white, providing visual feedback that helps you navigate the website with ease. The hover effect adds a touch of interactivity and engagement, making the user experience more enjoyable and satisfying.

  
  ## Header 

  <img src="assets/images/header.png" alt="printscreen of header" width="200" height="auto">

 The website features a unique header design that is both eye-catching and informative. The header is prominently displayed on the home page, featuring a stunning image of the ten-dollar bill with Alexander Hamilton's portrait. This design choice not only pays homage to Hamilton's legacy as the first Secretary of the Treasury but also fits perfectly with our white and green themed website.

However, I decided to exclude the header on certain pages, such as the about us, contact, and event pages, in order to focus more on the body content. The absence of the header creates a cleaner and more streamlined look, allowing visitors to focus on the information that matters most.

Despite the differences in header availability, we have made sure to maintain a consistent design language throughout the website, with a focus on legibility and ease of use. The use of white and pinegreen colors throughout the website creates a sense of unity and reinforces the brand identity.

We hope that the unique design of our header and the overall visual appeal of our website enhances your browsing experience and helps you connect with the rich history of Alexander Hamilton.
